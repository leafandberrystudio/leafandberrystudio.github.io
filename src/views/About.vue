  <div class="about">
    <p>Hello! I'm a constantly curious creator of handmade textiles and jewelry, inspired by my deep love of the world's natural beauty and passion for geometric designs. I especially love to dye silk scarves using real leaves, gathered in the beautiful NJ highlands that I call home.</p>
